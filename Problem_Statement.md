# Problem Statement & Product Definition

## Introduction
Media consumers today are overwhelmed by the number of shows available across multiple platforms. This leads to "Decision Paralysis" and "Progress Confusion"—users forget which episode they are on and lose track of their viewing habits over time.

## End User Profile
* **Target:** Heavy viewers of episodic content (Anime, TV Series).
* **Capabilities:** Comfortable with basic web/mobile apps and manual data entry.
* **Deficiencies:** Struggles to remember watch-history across different services; lacks awareness of their own viewing habits/time spent.

## Quantified Value Proposition
Our tracker eliminates the "What should I watch?" debate by providing a clear backlog and habit metrics. It saves the user approximately **10 minutes per night** of searching and provides immediate awareness of screen-time distribution, helping users manage their leisure time better.

## Product Core: Habit Awareness
The single differentiator of this product is **Personal Viewing Analytics**. While streaming apps only want you to watch *more*, our tool helps you see *what* you watch. By tracking genre distribution and time spent, we give the user a "Spotify Wrapped" style insight into their own entertainment habits.
