# Show Tracker: Cross-Platform Media Analytics

## Project Description
**Show Tracker** is a platform-agnostic media management tool designed to solve "Subscription Fragmentation." It provides a unified dashboard where users can track their viewing progress for shows across multiple services (Netflix, Hulu, Crunchyroll, etc.) in a single location. 

Unlike standard trackers, this project focuses on **Habit Awareness**. It provides users with deep-data metrics—such as total screen time and genre density—allowing individuals to analyze their viewing patterns and manage their leisure time more effectively.

### Core Features
* **Unified Search:** Find shows across all platforms via a single interface.
* **Progress Persistence:** Manually log episodes to maintain a "source of truth" regardless of platform migration.
* **Habit Metrics:** Visualize viewing data (Time spent vs. Genre interest).
* **Consolidated Backlog:** Manage a "Plan to Watch" list that stays intact even if subscriptions are cancelled.
